# manacher

- Unbounded knapsack: capacity inner ascending allows item reuse.

- Segment tree: half-open intervals `[l, r)` simplify the recursion base case.

- LIS via patience: each pile holds the smallest tail of length k.

- LCS DP fills a `(n+1) x (m+1)` table; reconstruct by walking back diagonally.

- Manacher expands around each center, reusing prior radii via mirror reflection.

- Maintain `[l, r]` and a counter; on counter-met-condition record the answer and shrink.

- Hash to a uniform 64-bit space; on tie, fall back to direct memcmp.

- Backtracking template: choose, recurse, un-choose. Mutate then revert.

- Iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion-limit issues.

- BFS layers carry implicit shortest-path distance in unweighted graphs.

- Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.
