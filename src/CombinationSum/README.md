# Combination Sum

All distinct combinations of `candidates` (with unlimited reuse) that sum
exactly to `target`. Sorted backtracking: at each recursion the start
index restricts to `candidates[i..]`, which both prevents duplicate
orderings and lets us early-break once `candidates[i] > target`. Each
solution is copied out of the running `path[]` so the caller owns it.
