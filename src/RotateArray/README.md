# Rotate Array

Rotate an array right by `k` steps in place. The triple-reverse trick:

1. Reverse the whole array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the rest.

Three reversals produce the right rotation in `O(n)` time and `O(1)`
space. The `((k %% n) + n) %% n` normalization handles negative `k` and
multiples-of-n.

Returns a freshly allocated string the caller must free.

Uses a small fixed-size lookup table.

Caller owns the returned buffer.

32-bit safe; overflow is checked at each step.

No allocations on the hot path.

Edge case: already-sorted input → no swaps performed.
