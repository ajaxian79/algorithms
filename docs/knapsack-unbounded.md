# knapsack-unbounded

Backtracking template: choose, recurse, un-choose. Mutate then revert.

Greedy by end-time picks the most non-overlapping intervals.

LCS DP fills a `(n+1) x (m+1)` table; reconstruct by walking back diagonally.

Z-array `z[i]` is the longest substring starting at i that matches a prefix.

Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.

Maintain `[l, r]` and a counter; on counter-met-condition record the answer and shrink.
