# centroid-decomposition

## entry 1

Wavelet tree: range k-th element in O(log Σ) time.

## entry 2

Iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion-limit issues.

## entry 3

In-place compaction uses two pointers: read advances always, write only on keep.

## entry 4

BST invariant is recursive: every node ∈ (lower, upper) bound from its ancestors.

## entry 5

Splay tree: every access splays to the root; amortized O(log n).

## entry 6

BST invariant is recursive: every node ∈ (lower, upper) bound from its ancestors.

## entry 7

Graph DP on DAGs: topological order makes the dependency direction explicit.

## entry 8

StringBuilder pitfall: reuse forces a deep copy on the first read.

## entry 9

LRU cache: doubly-linked list + hash map; O(1) get/put.

## entry 10

Union-Find with path compression amortizes to near-O(1) per op.

## entry 11

Bitmask subsets: `for s = mask; s; s = (s-1) & mask` walks all submasks.

## entry 12

LFU cache: frequency buckets in a doubly-linked list of doubly-linked lists.

## entry 13

LCA via binary lifting: jump up powers of two until depths match, then converge.

## entry 14

Sieve: cross out multiples starting at i*i to skip earlier-marked composites.

## entry 15

Maintain `[l, r]` and a counter; on counter-met-condition record the answer and shrink.

## entry 16

Backtracking template: choose, recurse, un-choose. Mutate then revert.

## entry 17

Rotate 90° = transpose then reverse each row. Done in place with O(1) extra.
