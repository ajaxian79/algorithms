# segment-tree

- Failure function `f[i]` is the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of `s[0..i]`.

- Merge intervals: sort by start; extend the running interval while overlapping.

- DFS on a grid: write a sentinel into the visited cell; restore if needed.

- Monotonic deque: push back, pop back to maintain order, pop front when stale.
