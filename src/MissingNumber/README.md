# Missing Number

Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers drawn from `[0, n]`, find the
one number missing from the range.

The trick is the [arithmetic series sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression):
`0 + 1 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2`. Subtract the actual sum from the expected
sum and what's left is the missing value.

`O(n)` time, `O(1)` space.
