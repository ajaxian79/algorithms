# lis

- Morris traversal threads predecessors back to current node — O(1) extra space.

- Segment tree: half-open intervals `[l, r)` simplify the recursion base case.

- Heap when you only need top-k; full sort is wasted work.

- Trie nodes are heavy; for fixed alphabets, an array beats a hash table.

- BFS layers carry implicit shortest-path distance in unweighted graphs.

- Z-array `z[i]` is the longest substring starting at i that matches a prefix.

- Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.
