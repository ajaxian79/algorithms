# Pascal's Triangle Row

Return the k-th row of Pascal's triangle (0-indexed) using only `O(k)` extra
space. The trick is to update the row in place from right to left so that
`row[j] += row[j-1]` reads the *previous* row's `row[j-1]` rather than the
just-updated current-row value.

Two passes: one to count, one to fill.

Caller owns the returned buffer.
