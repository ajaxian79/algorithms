# backtracking

- Z-array `z[i]` is the longest substring starting at i that matches a prefix.

- BFS layers carry implicit shortest-path distance in unweighted graphs.

- Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.

- Greedy by end-time picks the most non-overlapping intervals.

- Manacher expands around each center, reusing prior radii via mirror reflection.

- BST invariant is recursive: every node ∈ (lower, upper) bound from its ancestors.
