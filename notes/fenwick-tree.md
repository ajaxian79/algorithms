# fenwick-tree

- Segment tree: half-open intervals `[l, r)` simplify the recursion base case.

- Iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion-limit issues.

- Rotate 90° = transpose then reverse each row. Done in place with O(1) extra.

- Boyer-Moore: candidate + counter; reset on tie; verify on second pass.

- Hash to a uniform 64-bit space; on tie, fall back to direct memcmp.

- Walk both pointers from each end inward; advance the smaller side.

- Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.

- LCS DP fills a `(n+1) x (m+1)` table; reconstruct by walking back diagonally.

- Maintain `[l, r]` and a counter; on counter-met-condition record the answer and shrink.
