# Symmetric Tree

A binary tree is symmetric across the root iff its left subtree mirrors
its right subtree. Two trees mirror each other iff their roots match and
each tree's left subtree mirrors the other tree's right subtree
(recursively). One pure recursive `mirror(a, b)` covers it.

Edge case: single-element input → returns the element itself.

Edge case: already-sorted input → no swaps performed.

Two passes: one to count, one to fill.
