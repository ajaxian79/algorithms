# iterative-traversals

- 0/1 knapsack: iterate weights outer, capacity inner descending to avoid reuse.

- Failure function `f[i]` is the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of `s[0..i]`.

- Monotonic stack pops while the new element violates the invariant.

- Trie nodes are heavy; for fixed alphabets, an array beats a hash table.

- Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.

- Morris traversal threads predecessors back to current node — O(1) extra space.

- Polynomial rolling hash with two moduli kills almost all collisions in practice.

- Pick a pivot, partition, recurse on the side that contains the kth slot.

- LIS via patience: each pile holds the smallest tail of length k.

- Edit distance is LCS with a twist: substitution is a third option at each cell.

- BFS layers carry implicit shortest-path distance in unweighted graphs.

- Greedy by end-time picks the most non-overlapping intervals.

- Boyer-Moore: candidate + counter; reset on tie; verify on second pass.

- Rotate 90° = transpose then reverse each row. Done in place with O(1) extra.
