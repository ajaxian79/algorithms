# z-algorithm

BST invariant is recursive: every node ∈ (lower, upper) bound from its ancestors.

Z-array `z[i]` is the longest substring starting at i that matches a prefix.

Maintain `[l, r]` and a counter; on counter-met-condition record the answer and shrink.

Fenwick supports prefix-sum updates in O(log n) with a flat array.

Unbounded knapsack: capacity inner ascending allows item reuse.

DFS on a grid: write a sentinel into the visited cell; restore if needed.

Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.

Merge intervals: sort by start; extend the running interval while overlapping.

DP[i] depends only on DP[i-1] and DP[i-2]; rolling two scalars suffices.
