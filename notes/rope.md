## entry 1

- Sieve: cross out multiples starting at i*i to skip earlier-marked composites.

## entry 2

- Wavelet tree: range k-th element in O(log Σ) time.

## entry 3

- Trie nodes are heavy; for fixed alphabets, an array beats a hash table.

## entry 4

- Manacher expands around each center, reusing prior radii via mirror reflection.

## entry 5

- Dijkstra needs non-negative edges; binary heap gives O((V+E) log V).

## entry 6

- Merge intervals: sort by start; extend the running interval while overlapping.

## entry 7

- Tree DP: post-order DFS lets children inform the parent in one pass.

## entry 8

- Heap when you only need top-k; full sort is wasted work.

## entry 9

- Sparse table: idempotent operations like min/max — O(1) range query, O(n log n) prep.

## entry 10

- Skip list: probabilistic balancing, expected O(log n) per op, simpler than B-trees.

## entry 11

- Lower bound: smallest `i` with `a[i] >= target`. Always returns `[0, n]`.

## entry 12

- Failure function `f[i]` is the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of `s[0..i]`.

## entry 13

- Tabulation wins when iteration order is obvious and stack depth would blow up.
