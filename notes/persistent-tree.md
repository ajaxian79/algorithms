# persistent-tree

## entry 1

- Boyer-Moore: candidate + counter; reset on tie; verify on second pass.

## entry 2

- Z-array `z[i]` is the longest substring starting at i that matches a prefix.

## entry 3

- Sieve: cross out multiples starting at i*i to skip earlier-marked composites.

## entry 4

- DP[i] depends only on DP[i-1] and DP[i-2]; rolling two scalars suffices.

## entry 5

- Union-Find with path compression amortizes to near-O(1) per op.

## entry 6

- Graph DP on DAGs: topological order makes the dependency direction explicit.

## entry 7

- BST invariant is recursive: every node ∈ (lower, upper) bound from its ancestors.

## entry 8

- Morris traversal threads predecessors back to current node — O(1) extra space.

## entry 9

- DFS on a grid: write a sentinel into the visited cell; restore if needed.
