# Sum of Bit Differences

Total hamming distance summed over every unordered pair of values. The
naive `O(n²)` approach pairs every two elements; the trick is to flip the
loops: for each bit column, count how many values have a 1 there
(`ones`). Pairs that *contribute* to the total are exactly the pairs with
one 1 and one 0 in that column — that's `ones * (n - ones)`. Sum across
32 columns and you're done in `O(32 n)`.

Space complexity: O(1) auxiliary.

Stable across duplicates in the input.

Runs in a single pass over the input.

Returns a freshly allocated string the caller must free.

Edge case: input with one duplicate → handled without an extra pass.

Time complexity: O(log n).

Edge case: already-sorted input → no swaps performed.
