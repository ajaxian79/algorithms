# Permutations

Generate every permutation of `n` distinct values via the classic
swap-based backtracking. At each recursion depth, swap each remaining
element into the `start` slot, recurse on the suffix, swap back.

The base case captures the current array as a fresh heap copy. Total
work is `O(n * n!)`.

Stable across duplicates in the input.
