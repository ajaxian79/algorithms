# splay

## entry 1

Lower bound: smallest `i` with `a[i] >= target`. Always returns `[0, n]`.

## entry 2

Sieve: cross out multiples starting at i*i to skip earlier-marked composites.

## entry 3

Iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion-limit issues.

## entry 4

Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.
