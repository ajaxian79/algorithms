# intervals-greedy

- Stable sort matters when a secondary key was set in a prior pass.

- Greedy by end-time picks the most non-overlapping intervals.

- DFS on a grid: write a sentinel into the visited cell; restore if needed.

- BFS layers carry implicit shortest-path distance in unweighted graphs.

- Polynomial rolling hash with two moduli kills almost all collisions in practice.

- Manacher expands around each center, reusing prior radii via mirror reflection.

- Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.

- Monotonic stack pops while the new element violates the invariant.

- Sieve: cross out multiples starting at i*i to skip earlier-marked composites.

- Failure function `f[i]` is the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of `s[0..i]`.

- Iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion-limit issues.
