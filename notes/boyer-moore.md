- In-place compaction uses two pointers: read advances always, write only on keep.

- Polynomial rolling hash with two moduli kills almost all collisions in practice.

- Fenwick supports prefix-sum updates in O(log n) with a flat array.

- Lower bound: smallest `i` with `a[i] >= target`. Always returns `[0, n]`.

- Hash to a uniform 64-bit space; on tie, fall back to direct memcmp.

- DP[i] depends only on DP[i-1] and DP[i-2]; rolling two scalars suffices.

- Rotate 90° = transpose then reverse each row. Done in place with O(1) extra.
