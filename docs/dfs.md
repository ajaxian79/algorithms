# dfs

Fenwick supports prefix-sum updates in O(log n) with a flat array.

Lower bound: smallest `i` with `a[i] >= target`. Always returns `[0, n]`.

Greedy by end-time picks the most non-overlapping intervals.

Sieve: cross out multiples starting at i*i to skip earlier-marked composites.

Monotonic deque: push back, pop back to maintain order, pop front when stale.
