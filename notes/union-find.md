# union-find

- DP[i] depends only on DP[i-1] and DP[i-2]; rolling two scalars suffices.

- Heap when you only need top-k; full sort is wasted work.

- Hash to a uniform 64-bit space; on tie, fall back to direct memcmp.

- Boyer-Moore: candidate + counter; reset on tie; verify on second pass.

- Toposort via Kahn: in-degree zero first; cycle iff some node never drains.

- Stable sort matters when a secondary key was set in a prior pass.

- Pick a pivot, partition, recurse on the side that contains the kth slot.
