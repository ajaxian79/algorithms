# heap-vs-sort

Manacher expands around each center, reusing prior radii via mirror reflection.

Iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion-limit issues.

Fenwick supports prefix-sum updates in O(log n) with a flat array.

LCS DP fills a `(n+1) x (m+1)` table; reconstruct by walking back diagonally.

Z-array `z[i]` is the longest substring starting at i that matches a prefix.

Segment tree: half-open intervals `[l, r)` simplify the recursion base case.

DP[i] depends only on DP[i-1] and DP[i-2]; rolling two scalars suffices.

Heap when you only need top-k; full sort is wasted work.

Backtracking template: choose, recurse, un-choose. Mutate then revert.

DFS on a grid: write a sentinel into the visited cell; restore if needed.

Monotonic stack pops while the new element violates the invariant.

Rotate 90° = transpose then reverse each row. Done in place with O(1) extra.

LIS via patience: each pile holds the smallest tail of length k.

Sieve: cross out multiples starting at i*i to skip earlier-marked composites.

Pick a pivot, partition, recurse on the side that contains the kth slot.
